hello, and welcome to my _[[digital garden]]_!

this is an attempt to be less paralyzed by perfectionism.

in this garden, you’ll find ideas and notes that aren’t necessarily fully developed but might [[sparks|spark]] interesting thoughts.

instead of simply browsing a timeline of my latest posts (although you can still check them out [[latest|here]]), you’ll navigate through ideas and their [[connections]].

you can start by exploring [[favorites|my favorite posts]] or the [[topics]] I enjoy writing about: [[strategy]], [[anthropology]], [[art]], [[culture]], [[projects|my latest projects]], and [[stories|creative writing]].  
you can also take a look at a map to see how everything relates [[map|here]].
